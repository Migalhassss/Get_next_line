# Get_next_line

## Overview

`get_next_line` is a function in the C programming language used to read lines of text from a file or input stream, one at a time. This function is particularly useful for processing text-based files, parsing configuration files, or reading log files line by line.

This repository contains a sample implementation of the `get_next_line` function, along with a usage example to help you understand how to integrate it into your C projects.

## Features

- Reads lines of text from a file or input stream.
- Handles buffering and memory management to ensure efficient line-by-line reading.
- Supports reading lines of arbitrary length (limited only by available memory).
- Compatible with Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows.

## Usage

### Including `get_next_line` in Your Project

1. Clone this repository or download the all the files.

2. Add all the files to your project's source code directory.

3. Include the `get_next_line.h` header in your source files where you intend to use `get_next_line`.

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

### Example Usage

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main() {
    int fd;
    char *line;

    // Open a file for reading
    fd = open("sample.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }
    // Read lines from the file
    while (get_next_line(fd, &line) > 0) {
        printf("Line: %s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }
    // Close the file
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

## Build and Run

You can compile the example code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
```bash
gcc example.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
```

Then, run the compiled executable:
```bash
./example
```

## Acknowledgments

This implementation is based on the concept of reading lines from an input stream efficiently. It is inspired by similar functions used in various C libraries and projects.
